# The Ontology of Physics for Biology (OPB)

## Overview
The OPB is a reference ontology of classical physics as applied to the dynamics of biological systems.

It is designed to encompass the multiple structural scales (atoms to organisms) and multiple physical domains (fluid dynamics, chemical kinetics, particle diffusion, etc.) that are encountered in the study and analysis of biological organisms.  As a core technology for the Semantics for Biological Processes research group, it contains essential concepts for annotating biosimulation models. 

The OPB is being developed in the web ontology language (OWL) using the Protege ontology editing environment.
